# Complete Contract Address Integration

## Current Issue
Your contract addresses from the screenshot appear truncated. I need the complete 42-character addresses to properly integrate your deployed contracts.

## How to Get Complete Addresses

### Option 1: From Thirdweb Dashboard
1. Go to https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your deployed contracts
3. Copy the full address for each contract

### Option 2: From Chiliz Explorer
1. Go to https://testnet.chiliscan.com
2. Search for your admin address: 0x0734EdcC126a08375a08C02c3117d44B24dF47Fa
3. Look at recent transactions to find contract deployment transactions
4. Copy the contract addresses from the transaction details

### Option 3: From Browser Console (if you deployed via browser)
1. Check your browser's developer console during deployment
2. Contract addresses should be logged there

## Format Needed
Please provide all 5 complete addresses in this format:

```
PredictionMarket: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
FanTokenDAO: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
SkillShowcase: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

Marketplace: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

Once I have these complete addresses, I'll immediately integrate them and enable live blockchain interactions on your eSports platform.
