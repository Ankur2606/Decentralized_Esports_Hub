# Contract Integration Status

## Issue Identified
The contract addresses from your screenshot appear to be truncated. To properly integrate your deployed contracts, I need the complete 42-character addresses (including the 0x prefix).

## What I Need
Please provide the complete contract addresses for all 5 contracts:

```
Prediction Market: 0x[complete_42_character_address]
Fan Token DAO: 0x[complete_42_character_address]  
Skill Showcase: 0x[complete_42_character_address]
Course NFT: 0x[complete_42_character_address]
Marketplace: 0x[complete_42_character_address]
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend API error fixed
- ✅ Contract address input interface ready
- ✅ Web3 service prepared for live contracts
- ⏳ Waiting for complete contract addresses

## Once I Have Complete Addresses
1. Update constants file with real addresses
2. Initialize Thirdweb contracts for live blockchain interaction
3. Switch all testing functions from mock to live transactions
4. Enable real CHZ token interactions on Chiliz Spicy Testnet

Your eSports platform will then be fully functional with live smart contracts!
